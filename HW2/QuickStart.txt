Requirements:
Overview of Image Compression Using DCT
1. 2D-DCT
    - Convert to greyscale image --> Using Y formula
    - Visualize the DCT coefficients in Log Domain 
        -- Implement the 2D-DCT
        -- Log Domain
2. 2D-IDCT
    - Implement IDCT
    - Reconstruct the greyscale image
3. PSNR
    - Implement the PSNR
    - Measure the quality of reconstructed image
4. Two 1D-DCT
    - Implement two 1D-DCT 
    - Collect the DCT coefficients
5. Runtime
    - Compare both of them
